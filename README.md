# SNOW-JavaScript-Class

ServiceNow is currently at 
JavaScript ECMAScript 5... which does not have class type. 
- So it does not support full object oriented programming concept as other languages like Java or C#. 
- However, you can create a function in such a way so that it will act as a class.

## Add Methods in a class
We can add a function expression as a member variable in a function in JavaScript. 
This function expression will act like a method of class.

## Constructor
In JavaScript, a function can have one or more parameters. 
So, a function with one or more parameters can be used like a constructor where you can pass parameter values at the time or creating an object with new keyword.

## ES 6
- ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
- JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
- Use the keyword class to create a class.
- Always add a method named constructor()
- A JavaScript class is not an object.
- It is a template for JavaScript objects.

## The Constructor Method
The constructor method is a special method:
- It has to have the exact name "constructor"
- It is executed automatically when a new object is created
- It is used to initialize object properties
- If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.
